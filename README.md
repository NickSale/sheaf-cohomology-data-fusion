# sheaf-cohomology
Short Haskell script to compute cohomology of database joins for playing around while working through http://www.drmichaelrobinson.net/sheaftutorial/. (Note, works over â„š)

### Example 1:

Say we want to know a basis for global sections (i.e. globally consistent data) in the following straightforward database inner join:

db1 . select(Name, Age, PaysTax?) . innerJoin( db2 . select(Age, PaysTax?, National Insurance Number), on=(Age, PaysTax?) )

We might do:
```haskell
:load sheaf_cohomology.lhs
let schemaA = ["String","Number","Boolean"]
let schemaB = ["Number","Boolean","Number"]
let schemaAB = ["String","Number","Boolean","Number"]
let dbFormat = [[(schemaA,[]), (schemaB,[])], [(schemaAB,[(0, restrictionMap schemaA schemaAB [(0,0),(1,1),(2,2)]), (1, restrictionMap schemaB schemaAB [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)])])], []]

cohomology dbFormat 0
```
Which outputs (minus the interpretation):
```
[[0,0,1,0, 0,1,0,0],   (i.e. PaysTax? == True in both )
 [0,0,0,1, 0,0,1,0],   (i.e. PaysTax? == False in both)
 [0,1,0,0, 1,0,0,0]]   (i.e. Age is the same in both)
```
Indicating the observation that we can only be sure the join is correct for data which consists of only equal Age and PaysTax? variables, and no other data. It's worth noting that we can't take into account that some identifiers are unique, like the NIN.

### Example 2:
(todo) add example with non-trivial 1st cohomology (/todo)
